# Programmable Capital
Any resource or agreement which is registered and controlled in a fashion which enables consensus and structural interoperability of one or more facet through it’s life-cycle by an explicit owner.

Resource or agreement in this context refers to concepts including but not limited to assets, loans, property, rights, money, claims, licenses, securities, annuities, etc. The word asset is avoided in the definition intentionally, because we are discussing a superset beyond the US GAAP or IFRS Balance Sheet category, favouring instead resource which includes say, ether, which has no corresponding liability for another stakeholder.

Registration and control systems typically resemble architectures leveraging blockchains, distributed acyclic graphs or block lattices combined with cryptography solutions to maintain security in an immutable way.

Consensus refers to either the a latest snapshot or cumulative history across any necessary stake holder for anything registered and controlled (balances, code, execution results, etc.).

Structural interoperability refers the combination of ledger data and a programming language supported by a protocol, such as Solidity, or APIs such as the methods of a smart contract, associated with the capital’s current state and form.

The facets can span topics such as governance, incentives, utility, exchange and compliance.

The life-cycle spans transitions and states, such as definition, instantiation, modification, transfer, forking or burning.

Explicit ownership refers to changes of ownership being atomic, impossible to dispute within the definition provided by any codified governance. Implicit latent claims of liability cannot persist between ownership changes.
